## 🚀 Quick Start

### Architecture & Overview
Start here to understand the system:
- [System Architecture](01-architecture/README.md) - Complete system overview
- [Core Concepts](01-architecture/README.md#core-concepts) - Key domain concepts

### Backend Development
Server-side implementation guides:
- [Authentication System](02-backend/auth/Authentication%20System.md) - User auth & security
- [Database Layer](02-backend/database/Database%20Layer.md) - Data persistence patterns
- [API Design](02-backend/api/API%20Design.md) - RESTful API guidelines
- [User Management](02-backend/User%20Management.md) - User lifecycle operations
- [Error Handling](02-backend/Error%20Handling.md) - Error management patterns

### Frontend Development
Client-side implementation guides:
- [Frontend Components](03-frontend/Frontend%20Components.md) - React component library

### Quality Assurance
Testing and quality processes:
- [Testing Strategy](04-testing/Testing%20Strategy.md) - Comprehensive testing approach

### Operations
Infrastructure and configuration:
- [Configuration](05-operations/Configuration.md) - Environment setup & settings

## 🔗 Navigation Tips

### For Obsidian Users
- Use `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` to open links in new panes
- Access the **Graph View** to visualize document relationships
- Use **Backlinks** panel to see incoming references
- Try the **Random Note** feature to discover connections

### For GitHub Users
- All cross-references are clickable markdown links
- Use the file browser to navigate through folders
- Check the **README.md** in each folder for section overviews
- Use GitHub's search to find specific concepts across all docs

## 🏷️ Tag System

Documents are tagged for easy discovery:
- `#architecture` - System design and structure
- `#authentication` - Security and user management
- `#database` - Data persistence and storage
- `#api` - REST endpoints and interfaces
- `#frontend` - UI components and client-side
- `#testing` - Quality assurance and testing
- `#configuration` - Setup and environment management

## 🔄 Cross-References

This documentation system emphasizes **networked thinking** - each concept links to related ideas, creating a web of knowledge that mirrors your codebase structure. Follow the links to discover how different parts of the system interact and depend on each other.

## 🛠️ Maintenance

To maintain GitHub compatibility while using Obsidian:
1. Use standard markdown links: `[Text](path/to/file.md)`
2. URL-encode spaces in filenames: `File%20Name.md`
3. Use the included conversion tools and pre-commit hooks
4. Test links work in both environments before committing

**Setup Guides:**
- [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) - Complete setup and automation guide
- [agent.md](agent.md) - Guidelines for AI agents working with this vault
